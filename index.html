            <p>
              Instruction tuning large language models (LLMs) using machine-generated instruction-following data has
              improved zero-shot capabilities on new tasks, but the idea is less explored in the multimodal field.
              In this paper, we present the first attempt to use language-only GPT-4 to generate multimodal
              language-image instruction-following data.
              By instruction tuning on such generated data, we introduce <b>LLaVA</b>: <b>L</b>arge <b>L</b>anguage
              <b>a</b>nd <b>V</b>ision <b>A</b>ssistant, an end-to-end trained large multimodal model that connects a
              vision encoder and LLM for general-purpose visual and language understanding.
              Our early experiments show that LLaVA demonstrates impressive multimodel chat abilities, sometimes
              exhibiting the behaviors of multimodal GPT-4 on unseen images/instructions, and yields a 85.1% relative
              score compared with GPT-4 on a synthetic multimodal instruction-following dataset.
              When fine-tuned on Science QA, the synergy of LLaVA and GPT-4 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of
              92.53%.
              We make GPT-4 generated visual instruction tuning data, our model and code base publicly available.

- Optional: honey or maple syrup (adjust to taste)​

Instructions:​

1. In a large bowl, combine the sliced strawberries, blueberries, and carrot. Gently toss them together to mix.​

2. Drizzle the juice of half a lemon over the fruit and vegetables to prevent them from oxidizing and add a refreshing citrus flavor.​

3. Sprinkle the chopped fresh parsley or mint over the fruit and gently toss once more.​

4. If desired, add a drizzle of honey or maple syrup for a touch of sweetness. Adjust the amount according to your taste preferences.​

5. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the fruit salad for at least 30 minutes or up to a few hours. This allows the flavors to meld and creates a more refreshing salad.​

6. Serve the fruit salad in cups or bowls, garnished with a sprinkle of fresh parsley or mint, if desired.​

This fruit salad recipe is perfect for a healthy snack or side dish, and with the variety of ingredients available in your refrigerator, it should be easy to put together quickly.`]]

Second, be mindful of the structural integrity of the pier; avoid overloading it with too many people or excessive weight, as this could potentially damage the pier or cause it to collapse. Additionally, be aware of the surrounding wildlife and respect their space; do not harm or disturb them in any way. Finally, if you decide to go fishing, ensure that you adhere to any local fishing regulations and use appropriate fishing techniques to keep the lake ecosystem healthy and maintain the balance of the food chain.​​"],

            `Traveling to this picturesque location with a serene lake and mountains in the background was a refreshing and rejuvenating experience. The pier extending over the calm water provided an excellent vantage point from which to appreciate the breathtaking scenery. As I stood on the pier, I couldn't help but feel a deep connection with nature, taking a moment to soak in the peaceful atmosphere.​

One of the highlights of my trip was undoubtedly the fishing experience. The area is teeming with life, and I was thrilled to land a sizeable catch, despite the modest size of the lake. The joy of fishing in such a beautiful setting was truly rewarding, and it allowed me to take a break from my busy life and truly immerse myself in the tranquility of nature.​

While exploring the surrounding area, I came across a family of birds that had built a nest close to the pier, adding to the charm of the location. Interacting with the wildlife and observing their behavior was an enriching experience that I'll cherish for years to come.​

In conclusion, this idyllic destination provided me with an opportunity to unwind and recharge, surrounded by mesmerizing natural beauty and the gentle sounds of water and wildlife. If you're looking for a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, this pier overlooking the lake is the perfect place to find solace and reconnect with nature.`
